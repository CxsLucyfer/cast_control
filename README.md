# ðŸ“º Control Chromecasts with MPRIS
Control your Chromecast via [MPRIS media player controls](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/). MPRIS is the standard media player interface on Linux desktops.
`chromecast_mpris` allows you to control media playback on Chromecasts, and provides an interface for playback information.

MPRIS integration is [enabled by default](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/mediacontroller) in Plasma Desktop, and [there are options for GNOME, too](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1379/mpris-indicator-button/).
